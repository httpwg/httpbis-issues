# HTTPbis Issues

From 2007 to 2014, the IETF HTTP Working Group revised RFC2616, resulting in RFC7230-RFC7235. 

This repository contains a copy of the [Trac issues list](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/httpbis/report) used in that effort, to enable searching and convenient referencing from Github.

**It is not an active issues list for these specifications, so please do not file issues here.**

New issues for these documents should be directed to [httpwg/http-core](https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/).
